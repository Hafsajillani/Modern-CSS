Here's an explanation of the modern CSS elements used in the css code:

Custom Properties (--variables):

--column-count, --row-count, --column-size, --row-size: Custom properties are used to define variables that can be reused throughout the stylesheet. They are prefixed with -- and can be used to store values like colors, sizes, etc.
CSS Grid (display: grid):

.speakers-grid: This class is used to create a grid layout for the speakers.
grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows: These properties define the number and size of columns and rows in the grid, including the use of repeat notation (repeat(var(--column-count), var(--column-size))) and named grid lines ([list-start], [list-end]).
Positioning (position: absolute):

img: The position: absolute property is used to position the images within their container.
Transitions (transition: 500ms):

img: The transition property is used to create a smooth transition effect when the images change size or position.
Animations (@keyframes):

z-index-hack: An animation is defined to change the z-index property of images, creating a stacking effect.
Pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus):

a:is(:hover, :focus): This selector is used to apply styles to the anchor (a) element when it is hovered or focused.
Logical Properties (margin-inline):

.wrapper: The margin-inline property is used to set the left and right margins of the .wrapper element, respecting the writing mode (e.g., left margin in LTR languages, right margin in RTL languages).
Other Styles:

*::before, *::after: These are used to target pseudo-elements before and after elements.
html { color-scheme: dark light; }: This sets the preferred color scheme for the document.
h1, h2, h3, h4: These styles are applied to different heading elements.
p: Styles for paragraphs.
.section-title: Styles for section titles.
.flow > * + *: This selector targets elements that are siblings and follow another element.
.visually-hidden: This class is used to hide content visually while still allowing it to be accessible to screen readers.
img: Additional styles for images, such as setting the maximum width and ensuring they are displayed as block elements.
These modern CSS elements provide a flexible and powerful way to style web pages, allowing for more dynamic and responsive designs.
